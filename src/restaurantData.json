The broth is packed with flavor and the knife-cut noodles have a great bite. It is filled with delicious dumplings and topped with ground pork and veggies, making it my favorite sickness cure in LA.

Kobawoo House is known worldwide for their bossam, and they serve their pork with sides of cabbage, pickled daikon, radish kimchi, and salt fermented shrimp. Assemble all of these things together and you have a lettuce-wrapped sandwich that will rock your entire world. It is the perfect balance of saltiness, fat, acidity, vegetables, and meat and when I went for the first time I was shocked that a place this good had been sitting under my nose for years. Kobawoo House serves one of my favorite dishes ever and I highly recommend stopping by and trying bossam for the first time if you have never had it before.\n"

I believe at this point I have tried every single dumpling on the menu and I can fairly say they are all extraordinarily good. My favorites are the pork and kimchi bun, which has a slight kimchi flavor that really elevates the dish, the pork and shrimp steam roll dumpling, which comes with a delicious spicy sauce, and the shrimp, pork, and vegetables fried dumpling, which adds a lovely crunch to the equation. Make sure to use a lot of their addicting sauce and I always end up asking for extra banchan because their pickled radishes are that good.\n"

The skewers are small but range from around to one to three dollars a skewer so you can try a couple different kinds! Regarding alcohol, I would recommend YoJu (yogurt soju).

This taco is tied for my favorite item on the menu however- because the PacMan quesadilla will always have a place in my heart. This monstrosity combines all of the trucks meats (short rib, chicken, pork), cheeses, and signature salsas (green, orange, blue) into the single greatest quesadilla ever constructed.\n"

Their striped croissants look as good as they taste, and I'm sure their other pastries live up to this one. For my brunch, I ordered the croque madame, which was a fabulous version of the dish topped with just the right amount of bechamel and a perfectly done sunny side up egg. Their tartines also looked fabulous and are created with their artisan bread that I will certainly pick up on my next visit.\n"

In my opinion, this is a non-negociable for diners going for dinner. This chicken has crispy, flavorful skin while being incredibly juicy on the inside and is surrounded by a medley of complementary vegetables that elevate the flavor of the chicken immensely. \n"

I'm not sure what magic they work back there, but the fried chicken with honey hot sauce, chicken and waffles, and hot sandwich are all phenomenal ways to enjoy this special chicken.

Some of the highlights include the crispy morning glory salad, crying tiger beef, and Taepo chicken curry, but there are so many fabulous dishes to choose from that you likely have never heard of. Jitlada earned itself a Bib Gourmand recommendation from Michelin in 2019 and it was certainly well deserved.\n"

If you have never tried sweet rice cakes, I recommend you try their song-pyeon, which is a rice cake filled with honey and sesame filling. Just a word of caution- they are cash only and the employees speak limited English. However, if you want to try authentic rice cakes, don’t let that scare you and visit with a 20 dollar bill and google translate! -J\n"

I have heard up and down reviews on the freshness of the bagels themselves, but I have never had a problem personally. If you'd just like to cut that out, you can certainly just buy lox and take it home like you do at the supermarket and enjoy it at home.\n"

The meal starts with the delicious chips at the foyer, but make sure to not eat too many as you will be full for the main attraction. When it's time for that, the servers will come around with massive silver carts, ready to cut your prime rib right off the meat and onto your plate. If you really love the meal, you can go with the Diamond Jim Brady Cut, who was known for having a stomach 6 times the size of the average human. Actually, probably don't do that unless you want to die.\n"

The crust is thin and has a complex taste, while the cheese is perfectly melted and charred and the toppings they put are great as well. Some of their best options are the pepperoni, tomato and artichoke, and rigatoni. Yes, rigatoni. They have pasta pizza and it's great. Come for me. Lastly, don't forget to order the lorna luft chopped salad, which is stellar and one of my favorite chopped salads in LA.\n"
